Functionality implemented:
(pretty much everything in the assignment description):

	For testing, go to the order page and order a quick selection or build your own frozen yogurt. Add more orders
	by going to the order page again or hitting the "add another order" button. You can edit orders, delete them, or
	checkout. Checking out will not do anything if you are not signed in.

	Try signing in on the sign in page. Follow the rules (which you will learn via trial and error) and you will 
	be signed in with a premade customer profile (however, it does change your name on the profile to your username).
	This time when you checkout, orders will be saved in your history. Go to the order page and you can load previous
	orders.

Functionality not implemented:
	All session storage so there is no server side interaction.
	Customers can only have 10 orders at a time (because of how the code is written this iteration)
